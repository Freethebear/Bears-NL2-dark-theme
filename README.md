# Bears NL2 dark theme
 NL2 user interface reskin based on nlpx shared files
 
Based on nlpx's shared .xml files from nolimitscentral.com
(https://nolimitscentral.com/forum/topic/408?page=1#c12359)

Special thanks to Pieter and nlpx for helping me with problems along the way.

!!!Disclaimer: While this reskin only adds files to the game and can easily be removed again, it goes without saying that
 you should only do this at your own risk, back up your park folders if needed, I won't take any resposibilities for possible
errors and so won't the devs!!!

---------------------------------

HOW TO INSTALL:

Download: click  "clone or download" and selected "Download ZIP"

Step 1 (applying the theme): move the "skin" folder from the rar file into the \steam games\steamapps\common\NoLimits 2\data 
		               directory, launch the game.

Step 2 (changing the background): in the NoLimits 2 editor go to file -> preferences, in the "common" tab select
			       background colour and set the colour to R: 57, G: 66, B: 76

---------------------------------

I hope you enjoy this slightly flatter dark theme reskin for NoLimits 2.

The reskin isnt perfect, there are 2 known visual bugs (nothing game breaking, the control panel in the sim
having some of the text harder to read and the park selection window description preview text fields for each file not really being
readable until you select it) but I couldn't figure how to change those, if anyone comes up with solutions or wants to
work off of this you are more than welcome to.

---------------------------------

HOW TO UNINSTALL:

delete the "skin" folder from the \steam games\steamapps\common\NoLimits 2\data directory
